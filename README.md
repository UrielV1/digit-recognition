## Project objective  
- The aim of this project is to build ML model which can recognize digits with high accuracy.
## Project description
- A dataset of 70,000 images of numbers ranging between 0-9 is given.
- Each is image is composed of 784 features (28x28 pixels).  
- ANN model was tested using MLP classifier with one hidden layer of 16 neurons.
- RNN model was tested using 32 filters with kernel size (5,5). 
- Dimensionality reduction was executed using PCA method.
